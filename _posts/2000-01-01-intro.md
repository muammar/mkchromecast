This is a program to cast your **Mac OS X** audio, or **Linux** audio to your
Google Cast devices.  It is written in **Python**, and it streams via
`node.js`, `ffmpeg`, or `avconv`.

**mkchromecast** is capable of using lossy and lossless audio formats provided
that ffmpeg is installed. Additionally, a system tray menu is also available.
