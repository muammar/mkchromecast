# mkchromecast
{: .text-purple}

This is a program to cast your **macOS** audio, or **Linux** audio to your
Google Cast devices.  It is written in **Python**, and it streams via
`node.js`, `ffmpeg`, or `avconv`.

**mkchromecast** is capable of using lossy and lossless
audio formats provided that `ffmpeg`, `avconv` (**Linux**), or `parec`
(**Linux**) are installed. It also supports [Multi-room group
playback](https://support.google.com/chromecast/answer/6329016?hl=en), and
24-bits/96kHz high audio resolution.  **Linux** users also can configure [ALSA
to capture audio](https://github.com/muammar/mkchromecast/wiki/ALSA).

Additionally, a system tray menu is available.
